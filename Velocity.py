The function that computes the speed after "t" seconds have elapsed is given by:

v(t) = sqrt(mg/c) * (1 - exp((-sqrt(mgc)/m)t))

Where:

m = mass (in kg)
g = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2 on Earth, 24 m/s^2 on Jupiter)
t = time (in seconds)
c = 1/2 p A C
p = density of fluid (1.3 kg/m^3 for air, 1000 kg/m^3 for water)
A = cross sectional area of projectile (in square meters)
C = drag constant (0.5 for sphere, 1.1 for cylinder falling on itâ€™s side. You could look it up for other shapes.)
exp = the number e (2.71828) to the given exponent. This can be computed in Python with the Math library function math.exp(value).

sqrt = the square root of the given expression. This can be computed in Python with the Math library function math.sqrt(value).
