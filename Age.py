#Write a program that does the following:

#Prompt the user for their age. Convert it to a number, add one to it, and tell them how old they will be on their next birthday.

#Prompt the user for the number of egg cartons they have. Assume each carton holds 12 eggs, multiply their number by 12, and display the total number of eggs.

#Prompt the user for a number of cookies and a number of people. Then, divide the number of cookies by the number of people to determine how many cookies each person gets.
